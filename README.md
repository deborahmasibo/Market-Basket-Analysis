Carrefour Kenya was undertaking a project that would inform the marketing department on the presence of fraudulent sales. They provided a data set from
which the most important data set variables were to be identified. They aslo provided datasets to be used in the formation and analysis of association rules, 
and for anomaly(fraud) detection.

### PCA and Feature Selection

Correct identification of the most important variables from the data set was important as this could reduce the amount of factors to be considered during 
decision making and planning, to only the most relevant factors.

### Association Rules

The insights derived from analysis of association rules were important for planning stocking, advertisements, and promotions (to boost sales). Therefore, highly accurate information was required to prevent incurring losses as a result of remaing with a larger than expected closing stock, especially perishable goods.

### Anomaly Detection

Correct detection of anomalies was of importance as under reporting of sales is a crime, as less taxes will be filed. Plus, this activity, as well as 
over reporting of sales could have lead to incorrect restocking of goods, leading to product shortages, or over stocking respectively. This could have lead to heavy losses being incurred, or a great sales opportunity being missed (limited supply of goods in demand).
